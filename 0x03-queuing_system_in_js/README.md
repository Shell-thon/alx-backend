# Queuing System in JavaScript

## Resources
- [Redis Quick Start](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/8xeApIhnxgFZkgn54BiIeA)
- [Redis Client Interface](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/1rq3ral-3C5O1t67dbGcWg)
- [Redis Client for Node.js](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/mRftfl67BrNvl-RM5JQfUA)
- [Kue (deprecated but still used in the industry)(https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/mRftfl67BrNvl-RM5JQfUA0)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following without needing Google's help:

1. How to run a Redis server on your machine.
2. How to perform simple operations with the Redis client.
3. How to use a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations.
4. How to store hash values in Redis.
5. How to handle asynchronous operations with Redis.
6. How to use Kue as a queue system.
7. How to build a basic Express app that interacts with a Redis server.
8. How to build a basic Express app that interacts with both a Redis server and a queue.

## Requirements
- All code will be compiled/interpreted on Ubuntu 18.04, Node 12.x, and Redis 5.0.7.
- Ensure all your code files end with a newline character.
- A mandatory README.md file should be at the root of the project folder.
- Use the .js extension for your code files.
- Don't forget to run `$ npm install` when you have the package.json.

## Required Files for the Project
1. package.json

2. .babelrc
